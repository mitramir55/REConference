    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, weโll take a look at the general and most important steps of text cleaning before giving it to a machine learning or deep learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building deep learning or machine learning models takes weeks, days, or at least a few hours. To  improve the results, we utilize various packages, add layers, and apply different techniques. But what if looking at the data itself and modifying it a little bit, could help us with both performance and the training time of our model?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at textual data that hasn't been altered before, we'll see that people tend to use language as they please and without any special consideration of grammar or structure.  As a result, their words and sentences would be just a series of characters that canโt be properly distinguished and interpreted by our natural language processing algorithms and models. This makes our work a bit harder, meaning that we have to better clarify and prepare the data for our final algorithm.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But fear not! As Tomas Mikolov, one of the authors of Word2vec famous text processing algorithms says, building a deep learning model with the ability to learn the semantic relationships between words requires as little cleaning as possible. Because these models are capable of understanding which parts of the text to focus on (pay attention to), to achieve their objective. However, still, even a little cleaning will play a big role, as it reduces memory usage by shrinking the vocabulary size and helps you identify more words by deleting unnecessary characters around them.\n",

These words are called stopwords, and theyโre so commonly used that appear in all sorts and types of sentences. They donโt have any specific information to add to a sentence that may change the meaning completely, so we simply ignore them while performing tasks like text classification. Google often ignores them [2] when indexing entries for searching and when retrieving them as the result of a search query.\n",
